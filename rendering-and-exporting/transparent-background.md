# Transparent Background

### How do I make the background of my renders transparent?

This is a frequently-asked question in the FTC Discord, so we decided to make a section about it. 

Setting the background to transparent comes after the render has finished. There is no custom environment or HDRI that one must use in order to have a transparent background. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Although you can technically set the background to essentially any HDRI or color, be aware that its reflection can be seen in reflective objects \(e.g. acrylic and other plastics\)
{% endhint %}

Below is an example of a render that used a solid green background before exporting. The reflective field perimeter clearly shows hints of green, which is why **you may want to set the background to a more mute color.**

After your render has finished, click on the render and select the _Download_ icon. Here, you can slide the switch so that _Transparent Background_ is selected and then select the desired file type you wish to save the render as.
