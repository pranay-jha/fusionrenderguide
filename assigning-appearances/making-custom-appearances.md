# Making Custom Appearances

## Editing Existing Appearances

In the _Appearances_ tab, we can right-click on an appearance and hit _Edit_ to alter its properties, including color, roughness, and reflectance.

### Changing Roughness

For certain appearances, we can change the roughness to make the part look smoother or rougher \(a higher value means rougher\).

### Changing Reflectance

For certain appearances, we can change the reflectance, which affects the amount of light reflected by the part. The higher the value, the more reflective and shiny it becomes, and vice versa.

![Timing belt pulley set to &quot;Plastic - Glossy \(Blue\)&quot; with reflectance increasing from left to right \(0.015, 0.053 \(default\), and 0.08 respectively\)](../.gitbook/assets/pull.png)
