# Making Custom Appearances

## Editing Existing Appearances

In the "Appearances" tab, we can right-click on an appearance and hit "Edit" to alter its properties, including color, roughness, and reflectance.

## Changing Roughness

For certain appearances, we can change the roughness to make the part look smoother or rougher. Values closer to 1 increase the roughness, while values closer to 0 decrease the roughness.

## Changing Reflectance

For certain appearances, we can change the reflectance, which affects the amount of light reflected by the part. The closer the value is to 1, the more reflective and shiny it becomes. Likewise, a value closer to 0 will decrease the reflectiveness.
