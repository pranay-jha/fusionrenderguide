# Decals

1. To attach a decal to your model, navigate to the "Insert" menu within the design studio, and select the first option, "Decal", from the drop-down menu.

   3. Select the face for the decal to be applied to; orient and resize appropriately. Finally, turn off chain faces as this will create an undesired wrapping of the decal.
