# Tips and Tricks

* When assigning appearances to a robot with colors that are hard to distinguish from each other, it is best to separate each appearance by setting it to a vibrant color and changing it afterwards. For example, Team 9's robot in the CCC was mostly dark; as such the appearances were first set like below and then converted to shades of black and gray.

* Instead of navigating to the "Appearances" tab, you can press the "A" key on your keyboard. This is one of the most useful keyboard shortcuts to know when rendering.
